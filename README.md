# FourWeeksOfCode
I've set myself a challenge to code for at least half an hour every day for four weeks.

Day 0: (JavaScript)A few HOF's mainly using filter, some and map.  


    Filter: Returns an array of all elements that return true from the passed function.  
    Some: Returns true if at least one element in the array returns true from the passed function.  
    Map: Returns an array as a result of applying the passed function to all elements in the initial array.  
    

Day 1: (JavaScript)More HOF’s using find, reduce and every.  


    Find: Returns the first element in an array where the passed function resolves true. Otherwise returns undefined.  
    Reduce: Returns a new array that is a modification / amalgammation of the original. Essentially it flattens the data of the object to be another set of data. Example: creating a tally of all differing types within an array.  
    Every: Returns a boolean as to whether EVERY element in an array is equal. Definition of equal is proposed in the passsed function.
